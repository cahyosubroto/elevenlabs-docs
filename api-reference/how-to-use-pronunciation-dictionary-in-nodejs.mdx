In this tutorial, you'll learn how to use a pronunciation dictionary with the ElevenLabs NodeJS SDK. Pronunciation dictionaries are useful for controlling the specific pronunciation of words. We support both [IPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet) or [CMU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMU_Pronouncing_Dictionary) alphabets. It is useful for correcting rare or specific pronunciations, such as names or companies. For example, the word `nginx` could be pronounced incorrectly. Instead, we can add our version of pronunciation. Based on IPA, `nginx` is pronounced as `/ˈɛndʒɪnˈɛks/`. Finding IPA or CMU of words manually can be difficult. Instead, LLMs like ChatGPT can help you to make the search easier. Other than changing pronunciation, we also support aliases. For example, we could change pronunciation for `www` to `world wide web` or `11labs` to `eleven labs`.

We'll start by adding rules to the pronunciation dictionary from a file and comparing the text-to-speech results that use and do not use the dictionary. After that, we'll discuss how to add and remove specific rules to existing dictionaries.

## Requirements

- An ElevenLabs account with an API key (here’s how to [find your API key](/api-reference/text-to-speech#authentication)).
- NodeJs installed on your machine

## Setup

### Installing our SDK

Before you begin, make sure you have installed the necessary SDKs and libraries. You will need the ElevenLabs SDK for the updating pronunciation dictionary and using text-to-speech conversion. You can install required packages with the following command:

```bash
npm install
```

Next, create a `.env` file in your project directory and fill it with your credentials like so:

```
ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=your_elevenlabs_api_key_here
```

## Initiate the Client SDK

We'll start by initializing the client SDK.

```javascript
import { ElevenLabsClient } from "elevenlabs";
import * as dotenv from "dotenv";

dotenv.config();

const ELEVENLABS_API_KEY = process.env.ELEVENLABS_API_KEY;

if (!ELEVENLABS_API_KEY) {
    console.log("Missing ELEVENLABS_API_KEY");
    return;
}

const client = new ElevenLabsClient({
    apiKey: ELEVENLABS_API_KEY,
});
```

## Create a Pronunciation Dictionary From a File

To create a pronunciation dictionary from a File, we'll create a `.pls` file for our rules.

This rule will use the "IPA" alphabet and update the pronunciation for `tomato` and `Tomato` with a different pronunciation. PLS files are case sensitive which is why we include it both with and without a capital "T". Also, this rule will add pronunciation alias for `Mr`. We change pronunciation for `Mr` to `mistress`. In this case, we assume that `Mr` should always be capitalized so we only include the capitalized version. Save it as `dictionary.pls`.

```xml filename="dictionary.pls"
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<lexicon version="1.0" 
      xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2005/01/pronunciation-lexicon"
      xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" 
      xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.w3.org/2005/01/pronunciation-lexicon 
        http://www.w3.org/TR/2007/CR-pronunciation-lexicon-20071212/pls.xsd"
      alphabet="ipa" xml:lang="en-US">
  <lexeme>
    <grapheme>tomato</grapheme>
    <phoneme>/tə'meɪtoʊ/</phoneme>
  </lexeme>
  <lexeme>
    <grapheme>Tomato</grapheme>
    <phoneme>/tə'meɪtoʊ/</phoneme>
  </lexeme>
  <lexeme>
    <grapheme>Mr</grapheme>
    <alias>mistress</alias>
  </lexeme>
</lexicon>
```

In the following snippet, we start by adding rules from a file and get the uploaded result. Finally, we generate and save two different text-to-speech audio to compare the custom pronunciation dictionary.

```javascript
import { Stream } from "node:stream";

const saveAudioFile = async (
  audioNumber: number,
  stream: Stream
): Promise<string> => {
  return new Promise<string>(async (resolve, reject) => {
    try {
      const filename = `audio_${audioNumber}.mp3`;
      const fileStream = fs.createWriteStream(filename);
      stream.pipe(fileStream);
      fileStream.on("finish", () => resolve(filename)); // Resolve with the fileName
      fileStream.on("error", reject);
    } catch (error) {
      reject(error);
    }
  });
};


const pronunciationDictionary =
await client.pronunciationDictionary.addFromFile(
    fs.createReadStream("dictionary.pls"),
    {
    name: "example",
    }
);

const audio1 = await client.generate({
    text: "Without the dictionary: Mr tomato",
    voice: "Rachel",
    model_id: "eleven_turbo_v2",
});

const audio2 = await client.generate({
    text: "With the dictionary: Mr tomato",
    voice: "Rachel",
    model_id: "eleven_turbo_v2",
    pronunciation_dictionary_locators: [
        {
        pronunciation_dictionary_id: pronunciationDictionary.id,
        version_id: pronunciationDictionary.version_id,
        },
    ],
});

await saveAudioFile(1, audio1);
await saveAudioFile(2, audio2);
```

## Remove Rules From a Pronunciation Dictionary

To remove rules from a pronunciation dictionary, we can simply call `removeRulesFromThePronunciationDictionary` method in the pronunciation dictionary module. In the following snippet, we start by removing rules based on the rule string and get the updated result. Finally, we generate and save another text-to-speech audio to test the difference. In the example, we take pronunciation dictionary version id from `removeRulesFromThePronunciationDictionary` response because every changes to pronunciation dictionary will create a new version, so we need to use the latest version returned from the response. The old version also still available.

```javascript
const pronunciationDictionaryRulesRemoved = await client.pronunciationDictionary.removeRulesFromThePronunciationDictionary(
    pronunciationDictionary.id,
    {
    rule_strings: ["tomato", "Tomato", "Mr"],
    }
);

const audio3 = await client.generate({
    text: "With the rule removed: Mr tomato",
    voice: "Rachel",
    model_id: "eleven_turbo_v2",
    pronunciation_dictionary_locators: [
        {
        pronunciation_dictionary_id: pronunciationDictionaryRulesRemoved.id,
        version_id: pronunciationDictionaryRulesRemoved.version_id,
        },
    ],
});

await saveAudioFile(3, audio3);
```

## Add Rules to Pronunciation Dictionary

We can add rules directly to the pronunciation dictionary and call `addRulesToThePronunciationDictionary` from the pronunciation dictionary. The snippet will demonstrate adding rules with the class and get the updated result. Finally, we generate and play another text-to-speech audio to test the difference. This example also use pronunciation dictionary version returned from `addRulesToThePronunciationDictionary` to ensure we use the latest dictionary version.

```javascript
  const pronunciationDictionaryRulesAdded =
    await client.pronunciationDictionary.addRulesToThePronunciationDictionary(
      pronunciationDictionaryRulesRemoved.id,
      {
        rules: [
          {
            type: "phoneme",
            alphabet: "ipa",
            string_to_replace: "tomato",
            phoneme: "/tə'meɪtoʊ/",
          },
          {
            type: "phoneme",
            alphabet: "ipa",
            string_to_replace: "Tomato",
            phoneme: "/tə'meɪtoʊ/",
          },
          {
            type: "alias",
            string_to_replace: "Mr",
            alias: "mistress",
          },
        ],
      }
    );

  const audio4 = await client.generate({
    text: "With the rule added again: Mr tomato",
    voice: "Rachel",
    model_id: "eleven_turbo_v2",
    pronunciation_dictionary_locators: [
      {
        pronunciation_dictionary_id: pronunciationDictionaryRulesAdded.id,
        version_id: pronunciationDictionaryRulesAdded.version_id,
      },
    ],
  });
await saveAudioFile(4, audio4);
```
